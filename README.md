# Heart-Disease-Prediction-From-Patient-Data-
 This repository deals with ML model building to predict whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.Data is fetched from UCI repository. Link mentioned in the code. From a set of 14 variables, the most important to predict heart failure are whether or not there is a reversable defect in Thalassemia followed by whether or not there is an occurrence of asymptomatic chest pain. The variable we want to predict is hd with Value 0: &lt; 50% diameter narrowing and Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing. We assume that every value with 0 means heart is okay, and 1,2,3,4 means heart disease.
